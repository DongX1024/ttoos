[Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Open-Innovation-Imperative-Profiting-Technology/dp/1578518377)， Henry William Chesbrough ，Harvard Business Review Press; First Trade Paper edition (1 April 2003)

In today's information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation - which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies - is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, 'open innovation', which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the author's own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley.Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms, "Open Innovation" shows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R&D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business.

Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a company's ideas and technologies. Author Bio: Henry W. Chesbrough is an Assistant Professor and the Class of 1961 Fellow at Harvard Business School.

[Free Innovation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation),Eric von Hippel,November 2016， MIT Press

A leading innovation scholar explains the growing phenomenon and impact of free innovation, in which innovations developed by consumers and given away “for free.”

In this book, Eric von Hippel, author of the influential Democratizing Innovation, integrates new theory and research findings into the framework of a “free innovation paradigm.” Free innovation, as he defines it, involves innovations developed by consumers who are self-rewarded for their efforts, and who give their designs away “for free.” It is an inherently simple grassroots innovation process, unencumbered by compensated transactions and intellectual property rights.

Free innovation is already widespread in national economies and is steadily increasing in both scale and scope. Today, tens of millions of consumers are collectively spending tens of billions of dollars annually on innovation development. However, because free innovations are developed during consumers' unpaid, discretionary time and are given away rather than sold, their collective impact and value have until very recently been hidden from view. This has caused researchers, governments, and firms to focus too much on the Schumpeterian idea of innovation as a producer-dominated activity.

Free innovation has both advantages and drawbacks. Because free innovators are self-rewarded by such factors as personal utility, learning, and fun, they often pioneer new areas before producers see commercial potential. At the same time, because they give away their innovations, free innovators generally have very little incentive to invest in diffusing what they create, which reduces the social value of their efforts.

The best solution, von Hippel and his colleagues argue, is a division of labor between free innovators and producers, enabling each to do what they do best. The result will be both increased producer profits and increased social welfare—a gain for all.

## 2020 第二季度 主题：开源经济学

### 2020 年4月 第四期

中文版：[《开源的成功之路》](https://book.douban.com/subject/2153786/)， 史蒂文 ，外研社·哈佛科学人文译丛，2007.6

英文版: [The Success of Open Source](https://book.douban.com/subject/1899468/),Steven Weber ,Harvard University Press ,2004

《开源的成功之路》的编者提出的论点是，开源社区首创精神的意义尤为深远。通过探讨构成财产的基本概念，该社区重新改写了一些最基本的管理问题。与此同时，它正在重建软件世界的政治学和经济学。假如您就像编者一样深信，在未来，软件构成的一些核心工具和原则将指导人类如何协同工作，协助人们创造财富并开创美好的未来，寻求新思想和新问题的解决方案，那么，理解开源如何改变这些过程至关重要。作为一名政治学家，编者更关心社区的管理方式，而非技术本身。编者之所以对开源产生兴趣，正是因为这个新兴的技术社区似乎能够以一种非常新奇而动人的方式，解决在编者看来相当棘手但常见的基本管理问题。
